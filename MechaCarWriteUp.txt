Findings/Answers :
1. Length and ground clearance are below significant level of 0.05 , 
thus the alternative hypothesis is valid. In fact they are below 1 in million.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Slope is not zero, as p-value for length and ground clearance is below the significnt level. 

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This model indicates that length and ground clearance contribute the variation in mpg.
But the intercept is below the significant level, indicationg there are other parameters 
also contibute to non random change. R-squared value is 0.71 indicating that this model is 
reasonable first order approximation, but can be improved by having other parameters that
contribute the variation. Based on pearson's coeff, r>0.7 is strong for linear model.
For multi regression, r^2 at 0.71 or approximate r at 0.84 is good.

4. Created a linear model with just length and ground clearance. In the above we have the intercepts
and coeficiencts to predict mpg = -91.5573 + 6.0811*[length] + 3.5669*[ground clearance].
It will be good to plot it in 3d to compare. 2d comparison was good. Images in github/readme.

5. Created 2 linear model with one independent variable, a)length b)ground clearance
a)length : p-value was low (2.63e-06) for length as expected and the model was
mpg = -25.0622 + 4.6733*length
b) ground_clearance : p-value was 0.0198 below significant level. Model was
mpg = 19.4175 + 2.0222*ground_clearance
Linear scatter Plots were made and saved in README file.

B. Create a summary statistics table for the suspension coil’s pounds-per-inch 
continuous variable.

The metrics for three lots:	
m_lot	Mean_PSI	Median_PSI	Variance_PSI	Std_Dev_PSI
Lot1	1500.018	1500.206	1.146024	1.070525
Lot2	1499.571	1498.873	10.131511	3.183003
Lot3	1499.004	1497.981	220.010563	14.832753

Findings/Conclusion:
Lot 3 variance is at 220.010, which is larger than 100. The manufacturing 
process has a variance that cannot guarantee quality. These(Lot 3) coils may be 
partially scrapped, leading to higher cost. Note 3sigma for Lot 3 is 44.50, 
i.e 99.7% will fall in 1499 +- 44.5 PSI. which wider than for Lot 1/Lot 2 (+-3.21/+-9.54)

C.Determine if the suspension coil’s pound-per-inch results are statistically different from 
the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch?

Findings/Conclusion
We looked at the PSI distribution for normality, and 
found samples/population were all normally distributed.

P-value in all test are higher than significant levels. So cannot reject the null hypothesis

The population size was 150. So comparing a sample to population is better.
I think in this case both the tests could be applied. Using individual lots for paired testing
may indicate if there is a problem in the process of some of the lots, but this requires additional
parameters about the manufacturing process.




D. Design a study that compares the performance of the MechaCar prototype 
vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market?

Let us define performance for this study. All key parameters for which the customer will select 
and pay for the features, e.g 
	1.fuel efficiency
	2.reliability (#number of failures per 10000 miles or time etc)
	3.safety
	4.horse power
	5.options like color, drive type etc
	6. cost of maintenance

To make a statistically unbiased comparison we need historical data of the vehicles in the market
The data should be vaidated with 
	1. t-Tests (one , two, paired as necessary,e.g between make/model, sample/whole population, samples)
	2. linear/multi linear regression especially for key parameters like
		a. fuel efficiency
		b. reliabilty (#number of failures in the last 3 years for the vehicles in the market)
			- for our prototype , we have justify it (no data avialable yet or we have get internal data)

We can use this as supporting evidence to claim that our new prototype has better performance. 

Some of the hypothesis e.g for 
	A. fuel efficiency :
	1. null hypothesis : for similar #of cylinders the fuel efficiency is same as other makes or model
        2. alt hypothesis  : we are better by some %.
	
	B. Reliability :
	1. null hypothesis : for similar features we are the same as others
	2. alt hypothesis : we are better by #no.of failures/10,000miles etc.

	C. Safety :
	1. null hypothesis : for smiliar type vehicle the accident rate is the same.
	2. alt hypothesis : we are better because of our innovative safety systems 
		- linerar / multi regresssion can show this capability.
Data Collection :
	1. From service records for failures, cost of maintenace
	2. Dmv/insurance records for failures/accidents
	3. Internal test data. Need to work with the development/test team to get sufficient data 
	  for statistical comparison. This should cover the range, be of the right data type to 
	  do t-tests, regression models.
	4. test agencies for safety , (EPA)fuel efficiency etc.
